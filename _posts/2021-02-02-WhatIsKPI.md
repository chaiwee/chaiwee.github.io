title: Key Performance Indicator(KPI)
---

I have came across a term called the KPI when I was trying to improve my work performance.  
When I get to know more about this concept, I realize that KPI can not only be applied to measuring work performance in an organization, 
but it can also be used personally in increasing the effectiveness in other aspects of one's life, eg. measuring progress towards your life goals.  
Let's get down to the nitty-gritty!  


**Learning objectives:**  
1. What is KPI?  
2. What makes KPI effective?  
3. How to define your KPI?  
4. A SMART and even SMARTER KPI  

##1. What is KPI?  
A KPI is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives.  
Organizations use KPIs at multiple levels to evaluate their success at reaching targets.  

High level KPI focuses on overall performance of the business.  
Low level KPI focuses on processes in departments such as sales, marketing, HR, support and others.  

##2. What makes KPI effective?  
Too often, organizations blindly adopt the industry-recognized KPIs and then wonder why it does not work on their own business.  
One of the most important aspects of KPIs is that they are a form of communication.  
Start with the basics and understand what are the organizational objectives of your organization,
how you plan on achieving them and who can act on this information.  

This process should involves feedback from analysts, department heads and managers.  
As this fact finding mission unfolds, you will come to understand which of your business processes need to be measured and with whom the information should be shared.  


##3. How to define your KPI?  
Follow the steps below to define your KPI:  
- What is your desired outcome?  
- Why does this outcome matter?  
- How are you going to measure the progress?  
- How can you influence the outcome?  

- Who is responsible for the business outcome?  
- How will you know you've achieved your outcome?  
- How often will you review progress towards outcome?  

eg. Sales Growth KPI   
- to increase sales revenue by 20% this year  
- increase in sales allow the company to become profitable   
- progress will be measured in revenue growth ( measured in dollars spent)   
- by hiring more sales assistant, promotion  

- the Chief Sales Officer is  
- the sales revenue will have increased by 20% this year   
- monthly basis   


##4. A SMART KPI  
SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound  
- Is your goal specific?  
- Can you measure progress towards that goal?  
- Is the goal attainable?  
- How relevant is the goal to your organization?  
- What is the time-frame for achieving this goal?  

or   

adopt a SMARTER KPI  
with the addition of Evaluate and Reevaluate.  


** Note!  
** Develop a clear objective for your KPI otherwise you will end up wasting your time, money and resources that would have best been directed elsewhere.  
** Review the KPI on a weekly or monthly basis.
